# Example App from Intro Rails

This started out as an adopt an animal app, but we decided to add hobbies!

### Steps to run

1. Clone this app.
2. Inside the application directory, run `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`.
3. Run `rails s`
4. View our hobbies at `localhost:3000/hobbies`.

### Notes
To see some of the steps we took, run `rails notes`.  This command searches for comments that say `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `OPTIMIZE` and prints them out to the Terminal.
